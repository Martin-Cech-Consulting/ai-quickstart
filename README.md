# Disclaimer

The repository will be updated on non-regular base with additional information and in no particular order.

But because of the rapid development of frameworks and changes, it cannot be guaranteed to keep all provided information up-to-date.

However, as long as the concept is understood, it should be no problem to adapt the code to a newer version of the frameworks used or even different frameworks.
